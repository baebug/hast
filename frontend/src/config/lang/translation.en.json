    "Q1": "What kind of site is this?",
    "A1": "It's a site that gives you quick access to local stories and news that may pose a threat to travelers. Plus, it gives every article a 'traveler risk score' so you can make better judgments.",
    "Q2": "What is the risk score calculated based on?",
    "A2": "It is a risk score calculated for travelers and is based on the 'trustworthiness' and 'sentiment score' of the news article, the 'date of occurrence' of the incident, the 'sentiment score', and a hand-calculated 'category score' with appropriate weights. Each figure is normalized and based on a total score of 100, and the date of occurrence of the incident is an exponentially weighted average.",
    "Q3": "Where do you collect the news stories?",
    "A3": "The data presented on this site is all collected and processed by 'The GDelt Project' and is re-presented with a focus on information for travelers.",
    "Q4": "What is the timeframe of the data provided?",
    "A4": "For each country, we provide a year's worth of statistical analysis, and the location of incidents and related articles by detailed region are provided on a 3-day basis. All data is being updated every 15 minutes, which is the same as the GDelt data update frequency."
